Data used in Lending club loan data from Kaggle. In the above, code I have preprocessed the data using WOE and IV for coarse and fine classing wherever required. Otherwise it is straight forward preprocessing. This is going to be a series but not all the codes will be given out for the whole model. Contact me on LinkedIn if any assistance is needed.
Thanks
